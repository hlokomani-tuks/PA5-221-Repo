## Funcitonal Capabilities:
                Get access to home page:
                
To access the web app, you will need to clone the repository onto your
local machine and run it from a web-server of your choice. This is because
we are not required to host the web app.
Upon opening it on your localhost, you will be greeted with a home page that
shows a catalog of all the current wines on display. A user is able to sort
and filter the wines to find exactly what they are looking for.

                        Signing up:

A user can simply browse the sight unregistered, but in order to interact and
use the features they must be logged in. In order to log in, a user must create an
account. To do this, they can click on the "Sign Up" page in the navigation bar.
They will  be greeted with a page that prompts them to enter their information.
Near the end of the form, there are three radio buttons. You can either register as a user,
a critic, or a wine manager.
These critic's reviews are valued higher than the reviews of regular users, due to
their high expertise in the wine industry, hence the need to differentiate.
In order for a critic to be approved as critics, we would contact them and ask them to
provide their CV and other documentation to back up their status as a critic. A decision
is made internally and they are then able to submit critic reviews on the sight.
For the purposes of this demo, let us assume that this proccess is followed.
A wine manager has a special set of functions. They have the ability to manage wines
for specific wineries. They would also need to go through a verification process, but
for the purposes of this practical assignment let us assume this process is followed.

                        Logging in:
                        
Once registered, a user must then log in using the details they used when registering their account.
They will be prompted to enter their email and their password. Once logged in, they have the
capability of leaving a review on a wine.
If a user is not registered, an error will be displayed.

                        Reviewing a wine:
                        
If a user would like to review a wine, they can click on the wine they'd like to review from the
home page. Then there will be a textbox together with a button underneath it to submit the review.
If you are logged in and submit the review, a success message will be shown and you can 
continue browsing thereafter.

                        Wine management:
